# PS2-Japanese-English-Games
Database, ratings, OPL Configs, and Cheats for all games on the PS2 that can be played with Japanese Audio and English Text/Subs

Specifically with the intention of playing in 1080i or 480p on actual hardware, I own a Fat PS2 with a exfat internal SSD. All information will specifically be pertaining to my hardware but am open to adding information past that. 
I am doing this as part of learning Japanese, mostly to improve my listening comprehension.
