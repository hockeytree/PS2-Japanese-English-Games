# PS2-Japanese-English-Games

Recently recovered the spreadsheet and made it commentable here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14l5HfEMK2G1Y5HJwCDuwTxXJi7_Taf-yN7a1RInLoJ0/edit?usp=sharing

Database, ratings, OPL Configs, and Cheats for all games on the PS2 that can be played with Japanese Audio and English Text/Subs

Specifically with the intention of playing in 1080i or 480p on actual hardware, I own a Fat PS2 with a exfat internal SSD. All information will specifically be pertaining to my hardware but am open to adding information past that. 
I am doing this as part of learning Japanese, mostly to improve my listening comprehension. 

All of that being said, I think this is the most up to date set of configurations for ALL PS2 games, and I really reccomend using this as a new HD baseline setup
